StorageClass:
  # The Storage Class is generated by the Manila CSI Operator, based on available
  # share types that have been created in Manila. For CI purpose, we assume
  # that a "default" share type exists and will be used for the StorageClass.
  # If you run this manifest against an OpenStack cloud where there is no "default" share type,
  # you'll need to change the value.
